# Finding the Best Distribution for Datasets

The repository is about how to find the best distribution for our datasets. For that purpose, the #[Fitter](https://fitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library which is using SciPy in background and is very handy, useful and easy was used. The dataset used can be found in Kaggle in [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafaali96/weight-height).

For more details, [this Medium article](https://medium.com/the-researchers-guide/finding-the-best-distribution-that-fits-your-data-using-pythons-fitter-library-319a5a0972e9) which the repository was based on will be helpful in order to understand.
